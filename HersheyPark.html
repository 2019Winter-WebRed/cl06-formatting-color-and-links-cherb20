            <p>Hershey Park is a family theme park located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1906 by Milton S. Hershey. The park is now run by The Hershey Company.</p>
            
            <!-- this is a paragraph describing Hershey Park -->
            <p>The theme park features 13 roller coasters, 15 water attractions and 26 kiddie rides. One of their famous roller coasters, The Superdooperlooper, built in 1977, was the first modern looping coaster on the East Coast. A few of Hershey Park's famous roller coasters include Farenheight, Great Bear, and Sky Rush. The Park also has a Water Park that includes water slides, a lazy river, wave pool, and much more.</p>
            
            <!-- this is a paragraph describing Hershey Park -->
            <p>The park's height requirements are based on Hershey's candies. Instead of being a certain number of inches tall you will be qualified as a Hershey's candy. You can be a jolly rancher, Twizzler, Reese's, Hershey's Kiss, and more. For example, you must be 60 inches or taller to qualify as a Jolly Rancher. </p>
